Usage
  $ bumped <command>

Commands
  init     Initializes a new `.bumpedrc` file in the current directory.
           Bumped detects configuration files such as `package.json`
           by default, but you can add files with `add` as well.

  add      Add a new file in your current configuration.
           When you add a file, the shared version between the configuration
           files is recalculated to get the more high version possible.

  version  Prints the current synchronized version.

  release  Bumped a new version of your software, updating the
           version in your configuration files.

           bumped supports different release keywords styles, namely:

           semver:
            $ bumped release <major|premajor|minor|preminor|patch|prepatch|prerelease>

           nature:
            $ bumped release <breaking|feature|fix>

           numeric:
            $ bumped release <[0-9].[0-9].[0-9]>

  remove   Removes a file declared in the configuration file.
           The synchronized version is recalculated.

  set      Set or update a determinate property across the files
           declared in your configuration files.

           You can set Strings, Arrays or Objects:

           $ bumped set name newName
           $ bumped set keywords [ semver, management, cli ]
           $ bumped set authors.name newAuthor
